# cloud-ops-monitor
A scalable Kubernetes monitoring and security platform for cloud-native applications, starting with Nextcloud.


# Kubernetes-Based Nextcloud Deployment with Monitoring and CI/CD

## Project Overview
This project aims to deploy the Nextcloud application in a Kubernetes cluster and implement a continuous monitoring solution. Initially, the deployment will be on a local single-node Kubernetes cluster, but the project will later scale to AWS for a cloud-based deployment. The CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and security scanning tools will help manage the application effectively.

## Objectives
- Deploy a one-node Kubernetes cluster locally and deploy Nextcloud using Helm.
- Set up a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automating the build, test, and deployment process.
- Implement a monitoring system with Prometheus and Grafana, including a custom dashboard built with React.
- Develop a secure, scalable platform that can transition to AWS in the future.

## Features
### 1. Deploy Kubernetes Cluster and Nextcloud
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy a one-node Kubernetes cluster on your laptop using Minikube or kind.
- **Nextcloud Deployment**: Deploy the Nextcloud application using Helm, configure persistent volumes, and manage the database.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Prepare GitLab CI/CD pipelines and scripts to automate deployment processes.

### 2. Implement Monitoring System
- **Prometheus Integration**: Collect metrics from Kubernetes nodes and the Nextcloud application.
- **Grafana Dashboard**: Build a dashboard to visualize metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and pod health.
- **React Frontend**: Develop a React-based UI to interact with and display monitoring data, providing insight into cluster health and performance.

## Project Phases and Milestones

### Phase 1: Deploy Kubernetes Cluster and Nextcloud
#### Goal:
Deploy a one-node Kubernetes cluster locally and set up Nextcloud with CI/CD automation.

#### Tasks:
1. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Install and configure Minikube or kind.
   - Verify that the single-node cluster is up and running.

2. **Deploy Nextcloud using Helm**:
   - Use a Helm chart for deployment.
   - Configure storage using Persistent Volumes for Nextcloud data.
   - Set up environment variables for database configuration.

3. **Prepare GitLab CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Create a GitLab repository to store Helm charts and scripts.
   - Set up GitLab CI/CD with a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
   - Automate build, test, and deploy stages with integrated security scans using Snyk or Trivy.

#### Deliverables:
- Functional single-node Kubernetes cluster running on your laptop.
- Nextcloud deployed using Helm with necessary configurations.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for consistent deployment.

### Phase 2: Implement Monitoring System
#### Goal:
Develop a continuous monitoring solution with a user-friendly frontend for visualizing health metrics.

#### Tasks:
1. **Backend Monitoring System**:
   - **Prometheus Setup**: Deploy Prometheus in the Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Grafana Setup**: Set up Grafana to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.
   - **Alertmanager Integration**: Configure Prometheus Alertmanager for notifications.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - **React-Based Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard using React to provide visualization of metrics.
   - **Backend API**: Create API endpoints using Node.js/Express to retrieve data from Prometheus.
   - **Visualizations**: Display key metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, pod health, alerts).

#### Deliverables:
- Prometheus and Grafana deployed for monitoring Kubernetes and Nextcloud.
- React-based dashboard with real-time insights into the system.
- Configured alerting for critical conditions.

### Future Scalability Plans
- **AWS Deployment**: Transition from a local single-node cluster to a multi-node Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS EKS.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Migrate from local storage to AWS EBS and S3 for high availability.

## Technologies Used
- **Kubernetes Tools**: Minikube or kind, Helm
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager
- **Frontend/Backend**: React, Node.js/Express
- **Security Scanning**: Snyk, Trivy (in the CI/CD pipeline)

## Learning Outcomes
- **Kubernetes and CI/CD**: Deploy and manage a cloud-native application with Kubernetes, automate deployments using GitLab CI/CD.
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Set up and utilize a complete monitoring system for a cloud application using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Scalability**: Learn to scale the deployment from a local environment to the cloud using AWS.
- **Application Security**: Integrate container security scanning and enforce secure deployments.
